    <p>Life in Darkness exists because no one should face grief, trauma, crisis, or mental health challenges without access to real, structured, evidence-based support, regardless of their ability to pay.</p>

          <h3>Yvonne Hall</h3>
          <div class="about-role">Founder &amp; Executive Director, Life in Darkness</div>
          <p>Life in Darkness was founded from a single conviction: that emotional and cognitive wellness should never be a luxury reserved for those who can afford it, especially for individuals navigating grief, crisis, and life's darkest seasons.</p>
          <p>The organization's work is grounded in decades of education, entrepreneurship, and direct service. Its founder, Yvonne, is a curriculum developer and educator with training in technology, social and political science, and psychology, and has led initiatives across both the private and nonprofit sectors, including work with at-risk populations and service as a Guardian ad Litem in Florida and California courts.</p>
          <p>Yvonne is also the Founder and CEO of EQGenix Inc., an emotional and cognitive wealth advisory firm. Across both organizations, her leadership brings private-sector rigor, structure, and accountability into community-facing work.</p>
          <p>A mother of seven, grandmother of twelve, and woman of faith, Yvonne's life's work centers on walking alongside people in their hardest moments, not to fix what is broken, but to help them build what comes next.</p>
          <p>Two organizations. Two missions. One belief: human capacity is built, not borrowed, and no one should be excluded from the building.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: var(--text-dark); margin-top: 1.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.04em;">Life in Darkness is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. EIN: 33-1336378</p>

  <!-- CONVICTIONS -->

    <div class="container" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="section-label">What We Believe</div>
      <div class="section-title">Our Convictions</div>
      <div class="process-steps" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        <div class="process-step">
          <h4>Darkness is a Doorway</h4>
          <p>The hardest seasons of life are not endpoints. With the right support, they become the foundation of your greatest strength. We meet people in the dark and walk with them toward what's next.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
          <h4>Capacity Over Coping</h4>
          <p>We don't teach people to merely survive. We build the emotional and cognitive architecture that allows them to thrive, well beyond the moment of crisis. Builders, not borrowers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
          <h4>Access is a Justice Issue</h4>
          <p>Evidence-based mental health support should not be gated by income, insurance, or geography. Our programs are free because healing shouldn't have a price tag.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
          <h4>Community is Medicine</h4>
          <p>Isolation amplifies every crisis. Connection, authentic, non-judgmental, and sustained, is one of the most powerful healing forces we know. Everything we build is designed to foster it.</p>

Our core frameworks, licensed from EQGenix Inc., have been tested across corporate, education, and community settings before reaching the people we serve.</p>
          <p>This isn't self-help. It's capacity-building, giving people the cognitive and emotional architecture to not just survive their crisis, but to emerge from it fundamentally stronger.</p>
